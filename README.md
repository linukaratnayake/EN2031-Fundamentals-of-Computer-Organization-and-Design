# EN2031-Fundamentals-of-Computer-Organization-and-Design

This repository contains the files and reports submitted for the module EN2031: Fundamentals of Computer Organization and Design in the Semester 3 curriculum in the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

This module focuses on providing the basic knowledge in the fields of computer architecture and digital system design. The module encouraged the students in self studing the architecute and inner working of a computer motherboard and its main components, CISC and RISC processor architecture with examples, etc. Other than that, the students were assigned to design an ISA and a microarchitecture for a simple custom processor to meet a iven set of requirements.

A brief summary of the assignments are as follows.

## Motherboard Dissection
<ul>
  <li>Understanding the basic components that a modern computer motherboard comprises of.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

## Processor Dissection
Analysing the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), Microarchitecture, and Cache memory of two CISC and RISC processors separately followed by a critical comparison of the two processors.

## ISA and Microarchitecture Design

Designing an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and a microarchitecture to accomodate the designed ISA, for a custom processor which meets a gives set of requirements.
